During this project I wanted to find answers for below questions: 

1. Does GPD per capita has any impact on percentage of deaths?
2. Does life expectancy has any impact on percentage of deaths?
3. Does percentage of smokers has any impact on percentage of deaths?
4. Does diabetes prevalence has any impact on percentage of deaths?
